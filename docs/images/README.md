# Screenshots

## Adding the App Screenshot

To complete the README update, save the screenshot you shared as:
`app-screenshot.png`

The screenshot shows:
- Clean, dark-themed interface
- URL input field with "Fetch" button
- Available Videos/Audio section with Select All/None buttons
- Filename Template section with:
  - Selected Tags (Title, Quality, Uploader)
  - Available Tags (Format, Website, Video ID, Upload Date, etc.)
  - Preview showing: "Example Video Title - 1080p - Channel Name.mp4"
- Download Options with Mode and Format selection
- Progress bar and status display

This screenshot perfectly demonstrates the app's professional UI and filename templating feature.

## How to Add the Screenshot

1. Save the screenshot image from your application
2. Name it: `app-screenshot.png`
3. Place it in this directory: `docs/images/`
4. The README already references it at: `docs/images/app-screenshot.png`

## Alternative

If you prefer a different screenshot or want to add more:
- Additional screenshots can be added to this directory
- Update the README to reference them
- Consider adding screenshots showing:
  - Basic vs Advanced mode
  - Download in progress
  - YouTube authentication dialog
  - Audio processing options
  - Video enhancement options
