## 🎯 What Was Organized

### 1. ✅ Moved Review Reports to Archive
**From:** Root level  
**To:** `archive/reports/`

Files moved:
- CODE_REVIEW_REPORT.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md
- FINAL_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md
- README_IMPROVEMENTS.md
- README_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md

**Benefit:** Root level is now focused on application files, not analysis reports

### 2. ✅ Moved Backup Files to Archive
**From:** `extractors/youtube.py.backup`  
**To:** `archive/backup/youtube.py.backup`

**Benefit:** Backups are clearly organized and separate from active code

### 3. ✅ Enhanced .gitignore
**Added:**
- `.mypy_cache/` – Type checking cache
- `.dmypy.json` – MyPy daemon config
- `.env` – Environment variables
- `.coverage` – Test coverage files

**Improved:**
- Build artifacts section
- AppImage build files
- IDE files organization

### 4. ✅ Created Comprehensive Archive README
**Purpose:** Explain archive structure and contents

**Sections:**
- Directory structure with descriptions
- What's in each folder
- Why keep deprecated code
- When to remove archive
- Historical context

### 5. ✅ Created Repository Organization Guide
**Purpose:** Document the entire repository structure

**Contents:**
- Complete directory tree
- File organization principles
- What's in each key file
- Archive organization rationale
- Quick navigation for different users
